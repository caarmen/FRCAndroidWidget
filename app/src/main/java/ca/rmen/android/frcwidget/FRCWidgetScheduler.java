     * A bug (or maybe expected behavior?) has been observed on Marshmallow.
     * If the widget is supposed to update every night at midnight, the #schedule() method
     * uses the setRepeating() api.  If the device is idle (doze mode?) at midnight, we would expect the alarm
     * to be triggered when the device wakes up later.  This isn't the observed case however. It
     * appears that if the device is idle when a setRepeating alarm is supposed to trigger, that
     * specific alarm execution is skipped completely, and the alarm won't go off again until the next
     * scheduled execution (the subsequent day at midnight).  The user impact is that if the user
     * goes to bed before midnight every day, turning off the device screen before going to bed, the
     * widget will never (ever!) update.
     *
     * We attempt to workaround this by setting an exact alarm for tomorrow at midnight.  With the
     * setExact api, if the device is idle at midnight, the alarm may not trigger at midnight, but
     * at least it will trigger when the device wakes up later, which is good enough for us.
